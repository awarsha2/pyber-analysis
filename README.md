# PyBer-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
To analyze PyBer rideshare sample data, specifically to examine and visualize ride share fares over time and by city type. 

## Analysis

### Results
The following graph describes each city type's total fares over a period of four months:

As shown, the difference between each city type's weekly total fares is consistent over time. The reason for this is better shown through the raw data. 

The following chart details each city type's total number of rides, driver and cumulative fares, as well as the subsequent averages of their fare per ride taken, and fare earned per driver.

As shown, we can see the reason for the total fare differences is likely due to the sheer difference in number of rides between the city types. We can also see that while areas with lower demands for rides and driver competition have increased fare amounts (both per ride and per driver), that increase is not enough to offset the raw revenue of Urban areas. 

## Summary
Following the data, the following recommendations can be made:
- Assuming that the percentage of revenue to profit is consistent across city types, or that more profit is generated by larger ride volume rather than average fare per ride, it is recommended to expand PyBer into urban areas rather than rural ones. 
- If the profit percentage from rural or suburban areas is much higher than urban areas, it might be reasonable to expand into those areas instead. 
- If the discrepency of total rides between city types is due to a larger number of urban cities currently being serviced compared to suburban and rural cities, it would be advisable to expand to those areas as well. Further analysis is recommended to determine this case.
